Richelle -- 
Chloe - BUGFIX/ last nights work broke. Added AI generated images and working on getting them in a column style on the left side. Sizing needs to be done. Would like for container to be clickable and route to reviews
Mike - WIP destinations detail view, shows images. Looked into identity/scaffolding for future BUGFIX
Najma - WIP hovering over image for book now/rather than a button
      - Added distance (from earth to destination)

Note to Richelle-- nothing new is pushed since we are all still working on some bugs. Mostly all CSS based stuff so nothing to crazy going on <3

# Notes/ ToDo:

## Splash Page:
Layout
Implementing an API for random space photo
Nav Bar adjustments (less blasÃ©)
Styling

## Destinations:
Clickable images-
link to details for said location (possibly implementing api)
  -- distance from earth to destination
Stretch goal-- generate some cool ai images like vegas on mars etc for cool photos

## Identity-
authorization and login/register
many-to-many databases: like, one user can have many destinations

## Book a trip
will take to page displaying price, dates etc
Stretch goal: make a prize wheel that creates a trip for you.
