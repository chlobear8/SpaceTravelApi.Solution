Richelle -- 
Chloe - I haven't pushed yet, there's two errors in chloe2 branch. I was working on creating a dropdown menu that allows users to select an image from a database. Thought it would be cool on the splash page.
Mike - 
  - Added a Destination details view, it is super basic. 
  - Also added a details route to the Destination controller
Najma - Header styling for destinations page.

# Notes/ ToDo:

## Splash Page:
Layout
Implementing an API for random space photo
Nav Bar adjustments (less blas√©)
Styling

## Destinations:
Clickable images-
link to details for said location (possibly implementing api)
  -- distance from earth to destination
Stretch goal-- generate some cool ai images like vegas on mars etc for cool photos

## Identity-
authorization and login/register
many-to-many databases: like, one user can have many destinations

## Book a trip
